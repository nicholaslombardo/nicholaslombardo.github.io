          <h1 class="display-3">Simulating Atmospheres to Understand Climate</h1>		  
		  <p style="color:#fff;">I am a climate science PhD candidate at Yale University interested in modeling atmospheric dynamics to explore the climates of a vriety of planets, including Earth. After completing my undergraduate degrees in physics and math at Central Connecticut State University in 2017, I worked as an observational astronomer at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, where, in addition to modeling infrared observations of Saturn's moon, Titan, from ground based telescopes, I also supported the Cassini spacecraft during its final few months in orbit of Saturn.</p>

		  <p style="color:#fff;">Since beginning my PhD program in 2019, my primary research focuses on understanding the geophysical fluid dynamics (the winds) of Titan's atmosphere. My dissertation project involves developing new code for the Titan Atmospheric Model (TAM), to accurately simulate Titan's changing wind field. Over the next few years, my work will help to elucidate the causes and mechanisms that give rise to Titan's atmospheric phenomena.</p>

		  <p style="color:#fff;">My secondary research concerns the evolving role of subsurface waves in the Arctic Ocean, as measured from stationary moorings in the Beaufort Sea. Exploring how the propagation of these waves has evolved in the past may help us to understand the fate of mixing in the Arctic Ocean.</p>

			<h3>General Circulation Models</h3>
	  		<div class="row">
	  			<div class="col">
	  				<p> General Circulation Models (GCMs, sometimes also called Global Climate Models) are a way to simulate an atmosphere using a computer model.  To use a GCM, the model must be supplied with the physical characteristics of the planet being studied, like the planet's size, gravity, chemical makeup, distance from the sun, among other things.</p>

			<h3>Observational Astronomy</h3>
	  		<div class="row">
	  			<div class="col">
	  				<p>We directly learn about other planets by observing them with telescopes, a field called observational astronomy, and what probably comes to mind when someone thinks of an 'astronomer'.  Observational astronomy allows to determine many characteristics of a planet without leaving Earth, such as the temperature of the planet's surface, the thermal structure of its atmosphere, and the molecules that present across the planet.</p>
				    <p>While humans are accustomed to seeing the world around us in the 'visible' portion of the electromagnetic spectrum, it's we are only able to directly access a limited portion of what is around us.  To learn more about distant planets, it's helpful to look at other <b>wavelengths</b> of light, like ultraviolet and infrared.  Each of these different regions of the elctromagnetic spectrum contains different types of information.  Ultraviolet light tends to tell us more about electronic transitions in a molecule, which tend to occur higher in an atmosphere.  Infrared light tends to contain more information about how a molecule twists and bends (called a rovibrational state), and tends to include more information about the lower and middle atmosphere.</p>
					<p> For Titan, we can use infrared observations from both the Earth-based telescopes and space-based telescopes to explore the types of molecules that are present throughout it's atmosphere.</p>
